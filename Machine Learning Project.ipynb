Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U . S . or foreign banks , looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region . While declining specifics on his corporate strategy , when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan , Pinola replied , \" That ' s undoubtedly a fair statement ... it would be almost naive not to think that .\" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \" opportunistic \". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain , then add management to restore profitability , or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates , then cut costs by combining resources . The exception , he said , would be Texas , where he said most of the banks are already well managed , but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy . Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica , saying only , \" We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us .\" Banking analysts , however , consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot , not likely to happen any time soon . ...</td>\n",

She told Parliament that the bid by the U . K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L > to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case . \" I wrote to the prime minister of Japan , Mr Nakasone , on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid . I have not yet had a reply . We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is ,\" Thatcher said . Thatcher told Parliament that \" shortly ... We shall have more powers than we have now , when , for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available , then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do .\" Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa . But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company .  \n",

       "1647  FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp , Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy , but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought . In a wide - ranging interview , Pinola said he ' s looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991 , \" so as to resist any potential look at us ... to maintain our independence , if possible .\" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California . First Interstate , the fourth largest California bank , and the nineth largest nationwide , owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states . Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U . S . or foreign banks , looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region . While declining specifics on his corporate strategy , when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan , Pinola replied , \" That ' s undoubtedly a fair statement ... it would be almost naive not to think that .\" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \" opportunistic \". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain , then add management to restore profitability , or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates , then cut costs by combining resources . The exception , he said , would be Texas , where he said most of the banks are already well managed , but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy . Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica , saying only , \" We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us .\" Banking analysts , however , consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot , not likely to happen any time soon . ...  \n",

K . GROWING IMPATIENT WITH JAPAN - THATCHER Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the U . K .

She told Parliament that the bid by the U . K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L > to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case . \" I wrote to the prime minister of Japan , Mr Nakasone , on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid . I have not yet had a reply . We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is ,\" Thatcher said . Thatcher told Parliament that \" shortly ... We shall have more powers than we have now , when , for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available , then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do .\" Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa . But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company .   \n",

       "1647  FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp , Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy , but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought . In a wide - ranging interview , Pinola said he ' s looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991 , \" so as to resist any potential look at us ... to maintain our independence , if possible .\" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California . First Interstate , the fourth largest California bank , and the nineth largest nationwide , owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states . Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U . S . or foreign banks , looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region . While declining specifics on his corporate strategy , when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan , Pinola replied , \" That ' s undoubtedly a fair statement ... it would be almost naive not to think that .\" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \" opportunistic \". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain , then add management to restore profitability , or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates , then cut costs by combining resources . The exception , he said , would be Texas , where he said most of the banks are already well managed , but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy . Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica , saying only , \" We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us .\" Banking analysts , however , consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot , not likely to happen any time soon . ...   \n",
